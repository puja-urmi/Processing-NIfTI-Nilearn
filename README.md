# Processing-NIfTI-Nilearn

The NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) format is a standardized file format for storing and sharing 3D medical imaging data. It combines metadata and image data in a single .nii file or separates them into header (.hdr) and image (.img) files. The header contains essential information about image dimensions, voxel size, and scanning parameters. NIfTI supports various data types and is compatible with many neuroimaging software packages, making it a versatile and widely-used format in medical research and clinical applications.
